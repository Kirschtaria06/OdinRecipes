    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>Beef or pork (often fatty cuts like chuck or shoulder)</ul>
    <ul>Soy sauce and calamansi/lemon juice (for marinating and the sauce)</ul>
    <ul>Tomato sauce and sometimes tomato paste</ul>
    <ul>Garlic, onions, and tomatoes (sautéed as aromatics)</ul>
    <ul>Potatoes, carrots, and red bell peppers</ul>
    <ul>Bay leaves, salt, and pepper for seasoning </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol><strong>Saute the meat and aromatics.</strong></ol>
    <p>Start to saute by heating oil in a pot. Saute garlic and onion, and then add the beef. It is a good practice to soften the onion before adding the meat. This makes the onion taste sweeter. Add the beef and cook until all sides turn light brown. You’ll need to stir to cook the sides.</p>
    <ol><strong>Simmer in tomato sauce until tender</strong></ol>
    <p>Add tomato sauce and water. Let boil. It is time to tenderize the meat. Cover the pot, adjust the heat between low to medium, and cook for 60 minutes or longer until the beef gets tender. You can add more water to prevent the sauce from drying-up during the process.</p>
    <ol><strong>Add the potatoes and season your dish</strong></ol>
    <p>Add the remaining ingredients. Make sure to adjust the taste based on your preference. This means adding enough salt and pepper. You now have your Beef Mechado to enjoy.</p>
